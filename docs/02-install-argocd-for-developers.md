# Install Argo CD for Developers

The default "cluster" instance of Argo CD is meant for cluster admin tasks (such as creating new namespaces, managing role bindings, etc.), not for day-to-day application management.  In order to manage our Pet Clinic application, we will install a new instance of Argo CD in a new `argocd` namespace for Developers to use.

However, we first need to create the projects/namespaces that we will use in this demo.  They are:

* **argocd** - The namespace where the new Argo CD instance will be deployed.
* **cicd-tools** - The namespace for the shared CI tools (Nexus and SonarQube).
* **petclinic-cicd** _ The namespace where Pet Clinic `BuildConfig`, `ImageStream`, `Task` and `Pipeline` resources will reside.
* **petclinic-dev** - The "DEV" Pet Clinic environment.
* **petclinic-prod** - The "PROD" Pet Clinic environment.

To put all this in place, we will create a new *AppProject* and *Application* in the `openshift-gitops` Argo CD instance to manage these environments.  You can do this by executing the following command:

```
oc apply -k https://github.com/masauve-gitops/gitops-and-tekton-with-openshift/gitops/argocd/01-environments-ga
```

Once the environments *Application* is synchronized and healthy, you can execute the next command to create an *Application* to deploy and manage the Developer instance of Argo CD:

```
oc apply -k https://github.com/pittar-demos/gitops-and-tekton-with-openshift/gitops/argocd/02-argocd-for-developers
```

If you have the UI for the cluster instance of Argo CD open, you should see "argocd-developers" and "environments" *Applications*.  Once they are both healthy and green, the new Argo CD instance in the `argocd` namespace will be ready!

Like the cluster instance, you can login to the Developers Argo CD UI by clicking on the route that becomes available in the `argocd` project.  You can then login to this Argo CD intance using your OpenShift username and password by clicking on the **Login with OpenShift** button.

Keep the Argo CD UI open so you can see the magic happen during the next few steps!
